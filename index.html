              <br>
              <p class="card-text">My name is Rishita Gadi and I am currently a full-time MBA student at Georgetown University. I was born in India, raised in New Jersey, attened college in Philadelphia, and now reside in Washington DC. Thus, I would definitely consider myself a city girl! Some of my passions include playing soccer, learning new authentic Indian dishes to cook, and reading! The last book that I read and would highly recommend would be The Inner Game of Tennis by W. Timothy Gallwey.</p>
              <p class="card-text">During my sophmore year of my undergrad experience, I attained a coveted co-op internship at JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPMC). I interned as a Finance Analyst in the Corporate Investment Bank, specifically on the derivatives product. I was able to convert that internship into a full-time job opportunity and joined JPMC full-time in 2015 as part of their Financial Analyst Rotational Program. </p>
              <p class="card-text">I stayed at JPMC for around six years and advanced through numerous leadership levels and various roles. My latest role was as a Senior Financial Planning & Analysis Associate within the Mortgage Bank. During my time in that role I served as the right-hand to my CFO and drove key initiatives for the strategic outlook of the business. However, the part of my role I enjoyed the most was working with the technology partners, developing new technology skills, and improving the business through automation and machine learning. Thus, I made the decision to get my MBA and switch out of the banking industry and into the technology industry.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Thus far, my MBA has been an extremely fulfilling, educational, and extraordinary experience. This past summer I interned at IBM as the Program Lead for their Strategic Patent Business Incubator. My passion for delivering novel solutions, collaborating with others, and embodying a strong work ethic served me well at IBM as it led me to receive a return offer from IBM. I am confident that with my current MBA academic rigor, business incubator experience at IBM, and six years at JPMC I will make immediate contributions as an encouraging and thoughtful leader at a tech company!   </p>
